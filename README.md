In this scenario, I will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, I will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, I will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories was ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, I will create the sprint backlog and executed some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. 

My team has been asked to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. My stakeholders need the ability to create products, retrieve products, update products, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for the ability for customers to indicate that they "like a product and have the site display the like count on the product page.‚Äù In addition to the catalog functionality, they have asked that it be hosted on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 

My team will use ZenHub to provide a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, I will be driving the process. I need to leverage the skills I've learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and ZenHub kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become my user stories.
